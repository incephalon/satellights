    <p>The United States Code is the entirety of US Law passed in Congress. If a bill passes, it is codified here. </p>
    <p>The tax code is here in Title 26. The way Congress works is in Title 3. If you go bankrupt, the laws for that are in Title 11. Laws regarding things like murder are delegated to the states, which have their own Code.</p>
    <p>It is structured in the following titles:</p>
<ul>
